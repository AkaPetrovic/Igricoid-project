Frontend of an imaginary website for video game reviews with minimalistic design in mind that was a school project. This project has been accomplished using Next.js framework for React and React itself as a base for the majority of the project.
This application relies on the use of local storage of a web browser so at first the app should appear to be empty.
Below are the examples of data that should be put in the appropriate fields when providing input:

For reviews:
- Naslov: Forza Horizon 5
- Slika: forza5.jpg
- Kratak opis: Forza Horizon 5 je realisti훾na simulacija vo탑nje automobila
- Opis: Forza Horizon 5 je najnoviji deo popularne serije igrica koja se zasniva na zanimljivim trkama i realisti훾noj fizici vo탑nje automobila.
  
For users:
- Username: Aka
- Password: aka
  
There is a separate place for the comments inside of the local storage, but comments can be anything that user feels like saying about a review, therefore there is no right or wrong regarding commenting
For the field "Slika" there are a couple of valid values that are identical to the names of the images that are found inside of the public folder. There are 4 inputs that are considered valid: csgo.jpg, forza5.jpg, pubg.jpg, terraria.jpg
